# companionbot
Companionbot is a Discord Bot that focuses on fun social commands.

Such commands would for example be the ability to hug other Members in your Discord Server. These commands can be executed by different companions, which you will be able to collect, switch, and possibly trade.

## Hosting the Bot
A Demo of this bot can be invited to your Guild with this Link: https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=656528846396588035&permissions=70634560&scope=bot. If you want to host the bot yourself, you need to add a `token.json` to the configs folder. Then copy and paste the following into it:
`{
	 "token": "your token here"
}`

Feel free to report issues and suggest new features!
