<h2>About the Project</h2>
An open-source Discord Bot written in Node.js that aims to make social commands much more unique!

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
You can either use the Invite link to invite the official bot to your server, or host your own version (with own Databases etc.)!

<h3>Prerequisites<h3>
	
- Node.JS v10.x
- npm

<h3>Install</h3>
With NPM, install:
	- fs
	- better-sqlite3
	- better-sqlite-pool
	- discord.js
	- enmap
	- system-sleep
*Trouble installing better-sqlite3 or better-sqlite-pool? Check out https://enmap.evie.dev/install*

When everything is installed, create a token.js file in the config folder.
Format it like this:


    {
    	"token": "putthetokenhere"
    }

Type `node .` into a Terminal, and the bot should start up!
<h2>What does it do?</h2>
I'm glad you ask!
The CompanionBot is - like many others - a bot that focuses on fun social commands, such as hugs, pats, kisses, etc.
The key difference to other bots is, that you can **collect and switch between different companions** (essentially waifus), which will execute those commands for you. 
<h2>Contribute</h2>
Everyone can contribute by adding their own companion with its own images and Quotes, by using [this handy Form](https://companion.crc32.dev/# "this handy Form"), and sending the resulting .zip file to me on Discord (Flori#7676) or (what i'd rather like) making a GitHub Pull-Request.
<h2>Roadmap</h2>
My goal is to make this bot as good as I can. I do not have that many set goals, but if you happen to have any ideas: Please create an issue and flag it as "new"! :)

<h2>Contact</h2>
- Discord: **Flori#7676** [online like 24/7]
- E-Mail: trashflee@gmail.com [not checked that often]

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
This Project could not have been possible without some VERY helpful people. I will list all of them here!
<h4>Special thanks to:</h4>
- [crc32](https://github.com/crc-32 "crc32"). She created the CompanionMaker and lets me use her VPS to host the bot. She is amazing, helpful, and without her, this would genuinely not have been possible.
- Northy: Northy stood up for me and tried to put my bot on a popular Discord Server. Thanks bud <3
